# Cryptocurrencies


 ## Overview of Project
This projectâ€™s objective is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and to group them to create a classification system. 
The deliverables for this project are:

*	Preprocess the data for Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* 	Reduce Data Dimensions using PCA				
*	Cluster cryptocurrencies using K-means
*	Visualize cryptocurrencies results

## Software
Python, Pandas Jupyter notebook and Machine Learning. 

## Results 
### Preprocess the data for PCA.
In this stage of the data manipulation, inaccurate and unnecessary data was identified and removed from the dataset, null values were removed, a filter was applied, two columns were dropped (IsTrading and CoinName) and data was standardized with StandardScaler().

### Reduce Data Dimensions using PCA.

A new dataframe was created and the dimensions of the X dataframe were reduced to three principal components.

### Cluster cryptocurrencies using K-means.
Using hvPlot an elbow curve was created to find the best value for K and predictions were made on the K clusters of the cryptocurrencies.

### Visualize cryptocurrencies results.
Using hvPlot a 3D visualization was created for the three principal components created.

### Create a table using hvplot.table()
A table with tradable cryptocurrencies were created.
